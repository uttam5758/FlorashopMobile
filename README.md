# CyberShop

### ‘Best platform for your dream shopping on technological things’

# Description

### Since the internet service is growing companies and individuals started to use online platforms for the easiness and quick business strategies. Shopping through online became the hobby for user as well as time consuming. User can get information about product at the time of shopping. Ecommerce is the priority of my android application design. So, I have developed an Ecommerce application named Cybershop where all kinds of technological things like computer and its accessories can be searched and shop online. It is developed in flutter framework. This project is also developed in website with MERN stack whose API is use in this application. The individuals will be the end users of this application and the admin controls overall system in website.

## Feature

### Login and registration,

### Comment,

### review,

### payment,

### order,

### order history and details,

### cart,

### easy navigation.

# Technology used

## Flutter

### Flutter is open-source platform that enables development of applications from single codebase. I have chosen Flutter over native react and other platforms because with Flutter, we can build just one codebase and utilize it for several platforms, including the web, desktop, Android, and iOS. As a result, we can launch our application considerably quicker as well as eliminate costs, and drastically shorten development time. With the use of flutter, developer can build high-performance, scalable applications with attractive and functional user interfaces for Android or IOS.

## Node js

### Node.js is an open-source, single-threaded, cross-platform runtime environment for creating networking and server-side applications that are quick and scalable. Node.js excels at managing multiple connections at once. Node. js makes a good backend for these kinds of applications by providing serverless architecture and real-time communication support. Node. Js is also faster due to JavaScript. Because of the easy learning curve, large community being an open-source project, robustness that ensure the speed and performance of the application, scalable and few other specialties I have choose Node js in my project.

## MongoDB

### MongoDB is open-source document database that utilize a flexible schema for the storage purpose. It is almost 100 times faster than traditional databases. It supports heavy transactions on homogeneous database. Through this NoSQL database, queries will be faster. Not only this, but it also manages application more efficiently at scale. That’s why I have used mongoDB at my project.

# Challenges

### First challenge to implement this project was the device management in android studio as it was creating issues due to incompatible version of laptop and virtual emulator. The future builder operation was another head aching issue as the value didn’t come from it although all the necessary coding and logic was correct. Inside the project, payment integration was another challenge for me. In the project, java files were to be edited from the inbuilt files. It almost took two days for the research and hence actual configuration required is done.

# Future prospective

### In the future my application is expected to come with all the possible payment system like e-Sewa, Khalti, connect IPS and so on. Mobile app will be accessible for admin too. More features like real time chat system, order track system, etc. is the future of this project.

# Architecture(Repository pattern):

### The repository pattern is a design pattern in software development that isolates the data layer from the rest of the app. While the UI presents information to the user, the data layer includes things like networking code, Room databases, error handling, and any code that reads or manipulates data.

### Basically, it is simply used in the case we work when offline. Repository mediates between the domain and data mapping layers, acting like an in-memory domain object collection. This pattern enables offline caching where our app saves data fetched from the network on the device's local storage, resulting in faster access. If the device is connected to the internet, it will get new report data from back-end server and store it locally before showing what is stored. Else if the device is not connected to the internet, it will immediately get the stored data inside its local data source like SQLite. By using repository pattern, it will be easier to test, easier to maintain, which in turn reduce bugs during development

### A repository can resolve conflicts between data sources (such as persistent models, web services, and caches) and centralize changes to this data.

## Some advantages on using repository pattern

### A repository module handles data operations and let us use multiple backends. In a typical real-world app, the repository implements the logic for deciding whether to fetch data from a network or use results that are cached in a local database.

### When working with multiple data sources, such as both a networked resource and an offline cache, the repository ensures the app's data is as accurate and up to date as possible, providing the best possible experience even when the app is offline.

# State management

### State management centralizes all the states of various UI controls to handle data flow across the application. It manages the state of one or several user interface control systems like buttons, checkbox, dropdowns, toggles and some others. To handle the page when refresh the browser URL, this state management is used.

### Furthermore, getX and provider package of state management have been implemented in my project. GetX, a lightweight and reliable management framework is used in Wishlist of product details page. Getx.obs setstate the specific widget without updating the overall state of the application. Similarly, Provider change notifier has been used in the cart handling part of my project for managing the cart changes over the widget.



# Conclusion

### To conclude, cybershop is an ecommerce mobile application developed in flutter framework where user can shop the laptop and their accessories. This is user friendly and easy to use. It came with multiple features like login and registration, place order, payment integration, attractive profile management and so on. Persistence storage for offline database using hive. Since online shopping is more effective, informative and time consuming. Hence, I decided to develop this application.
